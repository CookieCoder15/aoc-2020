# aoc-2020

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020). They are written in Python 3.

**There are many possible solutions for each day in AoC, and the solutions here are by no means the best way of solving the puzzles as they were written with the aim of solving each puzzle quickly.**

## Setup

Each script reads its input from `input.txt` placed in the working directory. The input for each day can be found on the Advent of Code website, for example the input for day one is located at [https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1/input](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1/input).
